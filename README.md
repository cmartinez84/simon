## Known Bugs
_The game currently loads sound through audio tags on the HTML, which can only be played one at a time and uses JS to halt the currently playing sound if it is played twice in a row before finishing. Because of this, every now and then a player may hit a button twice but may not actually see two beeps in a row.  A future release will load the audio through JS.
